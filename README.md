## Disclaimer

This repository contains a project based on the final assignment for the **[BI Dashboards with IBM Cognos Analytics and Google Looker](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bi-dashboards-with-ibm-cognos-analytics-and-google-looker)** course on Coursera. The original assignment focused on creating and analyzing business intelligence (BI) dashboards/reports using IBM Cognos Analytics and Google Looker Studio. However, for this project, I have modified the assignment to utilize Snowflake's Snowsight.

## Project Scenario

At SwiftAuto Traders, my role as a data scientist involves analyzing car sales and profits for each dealer. My first task is to create visualizations and present them as a dashboard to my regional manager.

## Objectives

* Analyze the historical trends in car sales for SwiftAuto Traders
* Provide insights on car sales and profits for each dealer

## Datasets

For this project, we will use a modified subset of the [**Automotive Industry Sample Data**](./Automotive_Industry/), which is available in this repository.

The original dataset can be found here: [Automotive Industry Sample Data](https://accelerator.ca.analytics.ibm.com/bi/?utm_source=skills_network&utm_content=in_lab_content_link&utm_id=Lab-IBMSkillsNetwork-DV0130EN-Coursera&perspective=authoring&pathRef=.public_folders%2FIBM%2BAccelerator%2BCatalog%2FContent%2FDAT00142&id=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&objRef=i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8&action=run&format=HTML&cmPropStr=%7B%22id%22%3A%22i22898C2A4DD748F79E0FC2BD017F4FE8%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22reportView%22%2C%22defaultName%22%3A%22DAT00142%22%2C%22permissions%22%3A%5B%22execute%22%2C%22read%22%2C%22traverse%22%5D%7D)

## Task Information
**Task 1**: Create a dashboard titled as `Sales` to capture the following KPI metrics:
* Capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
* Capture Quantity sold
* Create a bar chart to capture Quantity sold by model
* Capture Average quantity sold

**Task 2**: Develop a column chart to display Profit by Dealer ID in the `Sales` dashboard sorted in ascending order.

**Task 3**: Create another dashboard titled as `Service` and capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
* Create a column chart to capture the number of recalls per model of car
* Create a treemap to capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
* Create a line and column chart to capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit.
* Create a pivot table with heatmap to capture the number of recalls by model and affected system

**Task 4**: Share the dashboards.

## Setup

Install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file. The command syntax is:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The [swiftauto_traders.py](swiftauto_traders.py) Python script has been provided to automate setting up a Snowflake environment, uploading CSV files, inferring their schema
